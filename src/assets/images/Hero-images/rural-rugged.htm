If it is not rugged, it is not rural!<br>Many corps members would agree that they had come across the call above, even before they embarked on their service year journey. One would have heard ‘rural rugged’ mentioned by our parents, senior friends or even colleagues. As they shared their service year experiences, a lot of them could not complete their story without referring to rural rugged. If they mentioned NCCF, they mentioned rural rugged.<br><br>What is Rural Rugged<br>Simply put, rural rugged is the core business of the Nigeria Christian Corpers’ Fellowship. Rural rugged involves reaching out to men, women and children in the communities, villages and environment, where Jesus Corps members reside. The main purpose of this outreach is to take the gospel of Christ to the nook and cranny of the society, spreading the good news and introducing many to THE TRUE LIGHT. It also serves as an opportunity to serve the community in diverse ways and bring good tidings to its residents, thereby ministering to others in different dimensions.<br><br>Jesus corps members have always turned up in large numbers to participate in rural rugged, both at the state level and the zonal level. Some of the activities that are carried out at the rural rugged are, distribution of clothing materials, medical outreach, counselling sessions, teaching adults and children, bathing of children etc. Residents of the communities usually receive the gifts with so much joy, knowing that such an opportunity comes but only once.<br><br><br>Rural rugged is mainly funded by the capitation paid by corps members (one-month allowance). God has indeed been faithful. He approves that rural rugged is indeed his business, by making resources available when needed. God has indeed been the sustenance of this great vision.<br><br>Through the platform rural rugged provides, a great number of souls won into the kingdom, have been recorded. The joy that corps members experience, when embarking on this evangelistic call, cannot also be forgotten. Men give themselves to prayers and fasting, in preparation for rural rugged. This spiritual exercise has allowed many to grow and step out in faith, obeying the call of their master. Regardless of the cold, heat or whatever harsh weather condition they might experience, many find fulfilment in being useful for the kingdom, and obeying the great commission, as given by our Lord.<br><br><br>Rural rugged has become a reference point in the lives of many. Through this platform, lives have been changed, impacted and blessed. Corps members can testify to the blessings they have received, by being givers, intercessors, and participants of rural rugged. Rural rugged should never die, rural rugged will never die, for it has the endorsement of God upon it.<br><br>There are yet many to be reached, there are still many places to go to. God will keep on sending his children out, to different places and cities, to answer this call. Make yourself available wherever you might find yourself, for the harvest is great but labourers are few<br><br>Learn more @<br><a rel=ugc href="https://www.nccfkebbimedia.com">www.nccfkebbimedia.com</a><br><br>From <br>Nigeria Christian Corpers' Fellowship<br>Kebbi State Chapter</div><p class=s> <b id="lpt89344037">1 Like </b> <b id='shb89344037'></b><p><img class="attachmentimage img" src="https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/11500721_ruralruggednccfkebbi780x470_jpeg85c865bae8d059b772e5c402419f3590"> <p><img class="attachmentimage img" src="https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/11500722_ruralruggednccfkebbi7768x575_jpeg96317a5dce001361c3cf3e8e00ae6a84"> <p><img class="attachmentimage img" src="https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/11500723_ruralruggednccfkebbi4768x576_jpeg760da5d27d80bbcd96e9af3dd34cc30e"> <p><img class="attachmentimage img" src="https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/11500724_ruralruggednccfkebbi9768x576_jpeg3f066e22e1601a8feb23b29cd55673b0"> <tr><td class="bold l pu"><a name="89371658"></a><a name="msg89371658"></a><a name="5845471.1"></a><a href="/5845471/rural-rugged-core-vision-nccf#89371658">Re: Rural Rugged; Our Core Vision | NCCF |</a> by <a href="/brunicekid"  class=user>Brunicekid</a>(<span class="m">m</span>): <span class=s><b>8:58pm</b> On <b>May 09</b>, <b>2020</b> </span><tr><td id="pb89371658" class="l w pd"><div class=narrow>NCCF will never die...
